Warning: openssl 1.0.2r is already installed, it's just not linked
You can use `brew link openssl` to link this version.

Warning: Refusing to link macOS-provided software: openssl
If you need to have openssl first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find openssl you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
